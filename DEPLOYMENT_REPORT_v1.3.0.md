**Production URL**: https://blacklist.jclee.me  
**Status**: ✅ LOCAL DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL / ⏳ PRODUCTION PENDING

## 🚀 Executive Summary

Successfully deployed v1.3.1 locally with major architectural improvements:
- **환경변수 의존성 제거**: File-based authentication system implemented
- **UI 복구 완료**: Local resource serving (CDN dependency removed)
- **수집기 통합**: Unified collection API endpoints
- **Production deployment**: Tagged and ready for automated deployment

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Version Information
- **Local Version**: 1.3.1 ✅
- **Production Version**: 1.1.10 (pending update)
- **Container Health**: All services healthy
- **API Response**: Normal performance

## 🔧 Major Changes in v1.3.1

### 1. Environment Variable Dependency Removal
- **Before**: All credentials from environment variables
- **After**: File-based auth via `instance/auth_config.json`
- **Implementation**: New `AuthManager` class for credential management
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully implemented

### 2. UI Resource Localization
- **Problem**: CDN resources not loading (Bootstrap, Chart.js)
- **Solution**: Downloaded and served locally from `/static/vendor/`
- **Files Added**:
  - `/static/vendor/bootstrap.min.css`
  - `/static/vendor/bootstrap.bundle.min.js`
  - `/static/vendor/chart.min.js`
  - `/static/vendor/bootstrap-icons.css`
- **Docker**: Added volume mount for static folder

### 3. Collection API Unification
- **Before**: Scattered collection endpoints across multiple blueprints
- **After**: Single unified collection blueprint
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/collection/trigger` - Unified trigger
  - `GET /api/collection/credentials` - Credential status
  - `POST /api/collection/credentials` - Update credentials
- **Benefits**: Reduced code duplication, cleaner API surface

## 🐳 Container Status

```

### Production Environment (jclee.me)
```
Status: Awaiting automated deployment
Current Version: 1.1.10
Target Version: 1.3.1
Deployment Method: GitHub Actions + Registry Pull
```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Local Deployment
- **Version Check**: v1.3.1 confirmed ✅
- **UI Resources**: Loading from local `/static/vendor/` ✅
- **Auth System**: File-based auth config present ✅
- **API Health**: All endpoints responding ✅
- **Collection Status**: Available with new auth system ✅

### Environment Variable Status
```json
{
  "auth_config_file": "/app/instance/auth_config.json",
  "credentials_stored": "file-based",
  "environment_vars": "legacy (backward compatible)",
  "primary_auth": "AuthManager (file-based)"
}
```

## 📈 Architecture Improvements

### Before v1.3.1
- Environment variables for all credentials
- CDN dependencies for UI resources
- Scattered collection endpoints
- Duplicate code across collectors

### After v1.3.1
- File-based credential storage
- Self-hosted UI resources
- Unified collection API
- DRY principle applied

4. **배포 준비**: Ready for production deployment via GitOps

## 🔍 Technical Details

### AuthManager Implementation
```python
# New file-based authentication
auth_manager = AuthManager("instance/auth_config.json")
credentials = auth_manager.get_credentials("regtech")
```

### Static Resource Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - ./static:/app/static  # Added for local resources
```

### Unified Collection Routes
```python
# Single endpoint for all collections
@unified_collection_bp.route("/trigger", methods=["POST"])
def trigger_collection():
    source = request.json.get("source")
    # Unified handling for all sources
```

## 🎉 Summary
