# Pipeline Status Update
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Time**: 12:48 KST

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Registry Authentication (FIXED)
- **Problem**: New pods failing with `401 Unauthorized` when pulling images
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Registry path mismatch: Helm chart had `registry.jclee.me/blacklist` instead of `registry.jclee.me/jclee94/blacklist`
  - Registry secret had dummy credentials
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Updated Helm chart values.yaml to use correct registry path
  - Recreated registry secret with proper credentials (admin/bingogo1)
  - Committed and pushed changes to trigger CI/CD
- **Result**: ✅ New pods successfully pulling images and running

### 2. Service Port Configuration (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Service was routing to wrong targetPort (2541 instead of 8541)
- **Solution Applied**: Patched service to use correct targetPort 8541
- **Result**: ✅ Internal access working correctly

## ❌ Remaining Issues

### 1. External Access via Domain (502 Bad Gateway)
- **Status**: Still failing with 502 from openresty reverse proxy
- **Working Access Points**:
  - ✅ NodePort: `http://192.168.50.110:32452/health`
  - ✅ Internal Service: Working correctly
- **Failed Access**:
  - ❌ `https://blacklist.jclee.me/health` → 502 Bad Gateway
- **Likely Cause**: External reverse proxy (openresty) configuration issue

## 📊 Current Deployment Status

```bash
# Pod Status
NAME                         READY   STATUS    AGE
blacklist-c49bf4c6f-8ljbh    1/1     Running   1m
blacklist-c49bf4c6f-h7dvf    1/1     Running   2m
blacklist-78d877788f-h6fnr   1/1     Running   19h   # Old pod
blacklist-c49bf4c6f-4qggv    0/1     Running   30s   # Starting

# Service Configuration
- Port: 80 → targetPort: 8541 ✅
- Endpoints: Active and healthy
- NodePort: 32452 (working)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **External Proxy Issue**: The 502 error is coming from the external openresty reverse proxy, not from Kubernetes
2. **Recommendation**: Check openresty configuration on the external server that handles blacklist.jclee.me
3. **Workaround**: Application is fully functional via NodePort access

## 📝 Summary

- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Working correctly after registry path fix
- ✅ **Pod Deployment**: New pods deploying successfully with correct image
- ✅ **Internal Access**: All services working correctly within cluster
- ✅ **NodePort Access**: External access via port 32452 working
- ❌ **Domain Access**: External reverse proxy returning 502 errors

The core Kubernetes deployment is now healthy and functional. The remaining 502 issue appears to be with the external reverse proxy configuration, which is outside the scope of the Kubernetes deployment.
