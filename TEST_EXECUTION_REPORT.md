## CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🔧 Immediate Fixes Required (Priority 1)

1. **Collection System Stabilization**
   ```bash
   # Fix collection data pipeline endpoint structure
   - Align /api/v2/blacklist/enhanced response format
   - Resolve data export HTTP status codes
   - Standardize analytics response schemas
   ```

2. **Error Handler Compatibility**
   ```python
   # Update error handling signatures
   - BaseError class constructor parameters
   - ValidationError field attributes  
   - Safe_execute function arguments
   ```

3. **Flask Context Management**
   ```python
   # Fix application context issues
   - API error decorators without app context
   - Profile endpoint token parsing
   ```

### 📈 Coverage Improvement Strategy (Priority 2)

**Phase 1: Critical Path Coverage (Target: 40%)**
- Service layer core operations
- Route handlers for main APIs
- Database operations and models
- Authentication and authorization

**Phase 2: Full Integration Coverage (Target: 70%)**
- Collection system end-to-end
- Analytics data pipeline
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (Target: 95%)**
