## Known Issues & Solutions

### Resolved Issues
1. **Memory Exhaustion**: ✅ Fixed with resource optimization
2. **Pod Scheduling**: ✅ Resolved with Recreate deployment strategy
3. **ArgoCD OutOfSync**: ✅ Configured with proper pruning policies
4. **Workflow Conflicts**: ✅ Consolidated to single deploy.yml
5. **Self-hosted Runner Setup**: ✅ Complete transition successful

### Remaining Considerations
1. **External Ingress**: Some 502 errors on external domain access
   - Internal services fully operational
   - Issue isolated to ingress controller configuration
   - Workaround: NodePort access available

2. **ArgoCD Sync Status**: Occasional cosmetic OutOfSync
   - Does not affect service operation
   - Resolves with periodic manual sync
   - Services remain healthy during OutOfSync state

## Operational Commands

### ArgoCD Operations
```bash
# Status check
./scripts/argocd-ops.sh status

# Manual sync
./scripts/argocd-ops.sh sync

# Configuration check
./scripts/argocd-ops.sh config

# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n blacklist

# Service health
kubectl exec -n blacklist <pod-name> -- curl -s http://blacklist:80/health
