## Key Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Future Claude instances will have clearer understanding of:
   - Production infrastructure details
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Code quality standards
   - Testing requirements

2. **Specificity**: No more generic instructions, everything is specific to this codebase

3. **Practicality**: Added real code examples and configuration snippets

4. **Completeness**: Covers development, testing, deployment, and production aspects

## Usage

The updated CLAUDE.md now provides comprehensive guidance for:
- Setting up development environment
- Running tests and quality checks
- Understanding the CI/CD pipeline
- Deploying to production
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Following code standards

This will help future Claude instances be more productive and make fewer mistakes when working with this codebase.
